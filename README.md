# Clr

This page provides supporting data for the study on the ClR, a chloride ion pumping rhodospin. The ClR has a chromophore, retinal linked to a lysine on transmembrane helix-G (the 7th helix from the N-terminal of ClR). Retinal isoermiazation triggered by light absorption will drive the Chloride ion through the channel of ClR. 

This study applied time-resolved crystallography method using the XFEL source at LCLS (SLAC, Menlo Park, CA). The structures of dark state (__t=0__) and five pumped states (__t=1,2,50,100 ps__) were determined to atomic resolutions (1.65A for dark, 1.85A for pumped states).

In this page, there are five groups of files, following the data processing steps:

1. __Fourier difference maps (DMAP<sub>obs</sub>) calculated from experimental data__: |F<sub>pump</sub>-F<sub>dark</sub>|<sub>obs</sub> * exp(i phi<sub>dark</usb>);
2. __Extrapolated maps (ExtraMap<sub>obs</sub>) calculated from experimental data__: (F<sub>dark</sub>+N<sub>ext</sub> * |F<sub>pump</sub>-F<sub>dark</sub>|<sub>obs</sub>) * exp(i phi<sub>dark</usb>)
3. __Refined atomic models__ : dark, 1-100 ps
4. __MTZ with structure factors__ : dark, 1-100 ps
5. __Fourier difference maps (DMAP<sub>calc</sub>) calculated from refined atomic models__
